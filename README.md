### Objectives
The ZOO project consists of making a zoo simulator in C++ that works on a turn-by-turn basis. 
He will be given several instructions which are:
The first is to create 3 types of animals, tigers, eagles and chickens. These animals must be able to have a name, age, sex, personalized diet, a particular life expectancy, mating and even diseases.
The second tells us to make tailor-made habitats for animals with maximum capacities of a certain number of animals in them as well as the probabilities of being sick and overpopulation.
The third brings a menu that allows you to join a market in order to make purchases and sales different depending on the items or animals, in this menu also opens a peculiarity in order to be able to finish the game. 
Given all this, you should create a clean interface in order to have a simpler and more beautiful use when launching this simulator.
This project also focuses on creating events/actions and visualizing them.
The events/actions we want you to do are fires, thefts, rotten meat as well as harmful to the seeds. 
We can say that this is a probability characteristic that must trigger an action. This action must communicate with the zoo in order to receive information for each element.
